-help, -h, -?, -man, -manpage:	Outputs a very brief manual, which contains a list of all available parameters

-config "X", -cfg "X", -c "X":	By default the config.xml file in the tool's directory is used as configuration. With this parameter a different configuration file can be chosen. X has to reference the path to and the configuration file itself.

-output "X", -out "X", -o "X":	The answer to a query is automatically saved in the "answers" directory. This parameter can be used to store it in a second file. X has to define this file by path and filename.

-timeout "X"s/m/h, -t "X"s/m/h:	With this parameter the maximum execution time of each tool can be set. If it expires the tool's execution is aborted. X refers to this time in seconds (e.g. 10s), minutes or hours.

-debug "X", -d "X":		The output generated during the execution of this tool can be set to different levels. X may be set to: "error", "warning", "normal", "debug", "detailed" (ascending precision from left to right). Additionally it can be set to "short", the output will then be equal to "normal" but shorter at some points. By default it is set to "normal".

-nogui:				If this parameter is added, the GUI will not be launched. Instead the currently stored benchmark in "data/data.ser" is directly executed.

-backup, -bak, -b:		To backup previously computed results on startup add one of these parameters.

-reset, -re, -r:		To reset BREW on startup add one of these parameters.

--from "X", --to "X":		If only some benchmark cases shall be executed these parameters can be used to set the limit.
